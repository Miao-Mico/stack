# Stack - Some Data Structures Together

## About

This package contains some simple data structures together.

## Status

![Constructing](<https://github.com/Miao-Mico/stack/blob/master/constructing.png>)

## Feature

- **Generic Type Element**

  In principle, you can store `any type data` into all these data structure, by means of appointing `the assign method` and `the free method` manually.

  This is a demo show my thought, it may have some problem and may not be very good, but we will make it look greater, won't we?

  ```c
  
  /* Generic type element Assign and Free function prototypes	typedef			*/
  typedef errno_t(*genric_type_element_assign_t)(void *gnc, void *src);
  typedef errno_t(*genric_type_element_free_t)(void *gnc);
  
  /* Generic type element demo												*/
  struct generic_type_demo_s {
  	char symbol;
  
  	char *string;
  
  	int number;
  };
  
  /* Generic type element Assign function										*/
  errno_t generic_type_element_assign(void *gnc, void *src)
  	/* Function may preform like copy the pointer src to the pointer gnc	*/
  {
  	assert(gnc);
  	assert(src);
  
  	/* The length of these data type below must be absolutely CERTAIN,
  		because it may use the memcpy(), for safety,
  		Or you need to allocate the memory for the type in advance,
  		then Store the address of the memory to the container,
  		when this element is useless, deallocate it yourself.				*/
  
  	struct generic_type_demo_s
  		*generic_type_gnc = gnc,
  		*generic_type_src = src;
  
  	/* This are pointer,i want to store many "*tack",
  		so malloc it as count * sizeof("stack")								*/
  	if (NULL == (generic_type_gnc->string = calloc(1, sizeof("stack")))) {
  		return -1;
  	}
  
  	/* Memcpy the content of the pointer point to							*/
  	if (NULL == memcpy(generic_type_gnc->string, generic_type_src->string,
  					   sizeof("stack"))) {
  		return 1;
  	}
  
  	/* Copy the value of src to the gnc.									*/
  	generic_type_gnc->symbol = generic_type_src->symbol;
  	generic_type_gnc->number = generic_type_src->number;
  
  	return 0;
  }
  
  /* Generic type element Free function										*/
  errno_t generic_type_element_free(void *gnc)
  {
  	assert(gnc);
  
  	/* Free the memory space allocated at the assign().						*/
  	free(((struct generic_type_demo_s *)gnc)->string);
  
  	return 0;
  }
  ```

- **Poly-Instantiation**

  I can only make sure it can `initialize multiple instances`, but `can't guarantee thread safety`, because i even have no experience at that place.

- **Integrated  Control Structure**

  You can use this `xxx_ctrl` to code more convenient in the IDE or Editor with `intelligense`.

  If you don't like it, you can `Disable it` by `xxx_CFG_INTEGRATED_STRUCTURE_MODE_EN` at it's .h file.

  Here is the template referenced From stack.h:

  ```c
  
  /**
   * @brief This type will contain all the stack control functions.
   */
  
  struct stack_control_s {
  	struct {
  		/* @brief This function will initialize the stack struct and the specified container.           */
  		errno_t (*init)(...);
  
  		/* @brief This function will destroy the stack struct.                                          */
  		errno_t (*destroy)(...);
          
          ...
  	}configuration;
  
  	struct {
  		/* @brief This function will return reference to the top element in the stack.                  */
  		void *(*top)(...);
          
          ...
  	}element_access;
  
  	...
  };
  
  ```

  

- **Divisible-To-Independent-Module**

  If you want to use List, you need to include all those files.

  â€‹If it is a member of any family, include the file of that family.

  Common family files include:

  1. x_cfg.h
  2. x_def.h
  3. x.c and x.h

- **Influenced By Cppreference**

  Count in? I means it may be some where is familiar with the CPP? May just the name, but learn from it  is endless.

## Include

- Container
  - Container Adaptor
    - [x] Stack
    - [x] Queue
    - [ ] ...
  - Sequence Container
    - Array Family
      - [x] Array
      - [x] Vector
    - List Family
      - [x] Forward_list
      - [ ] List
    - ...
  - Tree
    - [x] Binary Search Tree
    - [x] Red Black Tree
    - [ ] AVL Tree
    - [x] B Tree
    - [ ] B+ Tree
    - [ ] ...

- Algorithm

  - Sort
    - [x] Bubble Sort
    - [ ] ...
  - Compare
    - [x] Greater
    - [x] Lesser
    - [ ] ...

- Allocator

  - [x] Allocator common

    It is simple add a shell for the malloc() and free().

  - [ ] ...

- Debug Component

  - Stack back trace

    I think of it because i want to make sure the malloc() and the free() can match themselves.

    It can get much information from the stack trace, of course, it depends on `the WIN32 Api`, you can watch more from the MS's doc, [click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/capturestackbacktrace).

    Now, it only support the windows platform.

    The API is `CaptureStackBackTrace()`;

    ```c
    #include <DbgHelp.h>
    
    #pragma comment(lib, "Dbghelp.lib")
    
    /* The Lib environment should be upward. */
    
    USHORT WINAPI CaptureStackBackTrace(
      _In_      ULONG  FramesToSkip,
      _In_      ULONG  FramesToCapture,
      _Out_     PVOID  *BackTrace,
      _Out_opt_ PULONG BackTraceHash
    );
    ```

All these `...` mean they may be ready to add.
